Abstraction
===========

1. [What is Abstraction?](#abstraction)
2. [How abstraction used in java?]()

**Abstraction:** Abstraction is a technique for managing complexity of computer systems. Abstraction is the heart of each and every OOP\(i.e Object oriented Programming\) language. Abstraction simply means to hide the implementation from the user. User don't have to know the implementation of the method you provide to work with, he/she needs to know only the functionality of that method. There are two types of abstraction present in every object oriented programming language. 
Namely : 
    a\) Data Abstraction &
    b\) Control Abstraction.

        **Data Abstraction:** Data abstraction means hide the implementation details from the user. Users don't have access
        to the implementation of the classes and don't need to have that. Because user gets an interface of the project 
        \( i.e how to interact with the class or other part of the project.\) They need not know the whole scenario and the 
        implementation of the library or project. They just know the working functions of the library and it's all they need.
        All OOP is built to fulfill this firstly. It is much less of a headache for user and the programmer also. The library
        code may be changed later for performance issue or for other reason but user don't need to worry about that he/she 
        knows the upper layer functionality and coder/programmer can manage the code very efficiently if he/she follows 
        the abstraction rules.
