1. [What is Inheritance?]()
2. [Types of inheritance.]()
3. [Why is it required in Java as well as Android?]()
4. [Give real world example of inheritance.]()

___Definition :___ <p>Inheritance means inheriting something from others. In real world inheritance means inheriting 
 characteristics and other things from parents. As a human being we are inheriting many things from our parents \(e.g 
 our hand, nose, mouth and all other parts of the body is an example of inheritance\). In java inheritance means inheriting
 properties and methods from the parent class which we are extending in our desired class. As an example we can tell that a
 vehicle class has the methods start, accelerate, stop as well as so on. Now if we create another class namely car which inherits
 from the vehicle class it will also have the methods available to the vehicle class and also we can add extra methods and properties 
 to the child class. 
 
 ___Types of Inheritance :___ <p>The types of inheritance are given below.
  <br>
 a\) Single Inheritance, <br>
 b\) Multiple Inheritance, <br>
 c\) Multilevel Inheritance, <br>
 d\) Hierarchical Inheritance & <br>
 e\) Hybrid Inheritance
 <br><br>
 ___a\) Single Inheritance :___ Single inheritance is the easiest one to understand and use. In single inheritance one child class is inheriting from the parent class. You can find the example in the single inheritance demo package.
 there you can find two classes one parent class Vehicle and one child class Car which is inheriting from the parent Vehicle class. Here only one class is inheriting from one parent class. This type of inheritance is called single
 inheritance.
 <br><br>
 ___b\) Multiple Inheritance :___ Multiple inheritance means inheriting from multiple parents. Multiple inheritance is not supported in java. One can find multiple inheritance very confusing. C++ supports Multiple inheritance but java.
 <br><br>
 ___c\) Multilevel Inheritance :___ 
 <br><br>
 ___d\) Hierarchical Inheritance :___ 
 <br><br>
 ___e\) Hybrid Inheritance :___
