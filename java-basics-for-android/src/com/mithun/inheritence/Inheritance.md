3. [Why is it required in Java as well as Android?]()
4. [Give real world example of inheritance.]()

___Definition :___ <p>Inheritance means inheriting something from others. In real world inheritance means inheriting 
 characteristics and other things from parents. As a human being we are inheriting many things from our parents \(e.g 
 our hand, nose, mouth and all other parts of the body is an example of inheritance\). In java inheritance means inheriting
 properties and methods from the parent class which we are extending in our desired class. As an example we can tell that a
 vehicle class has the methods start, accelerate, stop as well as so on. Now if we create another class namely car which inherits
 from the vehicle class it will also have the methods available to the vehicle class and also we can add extra methods and properties 
 to the child class.
