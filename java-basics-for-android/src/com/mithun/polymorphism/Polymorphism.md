Polymorphism In Java.
==========================================================

1\) [What is Polymorphism?]()<br>
2\) [Concept of Polymorphism in java.]()<br>

___Definition :___
 <p> The word Ploymorphism is composed of two different words
 namely poly and morph poly means many and morph means forms so
 polymorphism means the different forms of the same thing. In one 
 word we can say that polymorphism means **one name many forms**. 
 As an example we can say that in real life a single person have one
 name but he/she has many forms. As a lerner you can take yourself
 into account. In here you are a student or learner, in your home you
 are children to your father or mother, you are brother/sister to
 your siblings, you are uncle to your nephew or nice. So here you are
 a single person but you have different form to different persons. As 
 another example from the materials we can take into account carbons 
 polymorphic characteristics. Carbon has the 4 different forms namely 
 carbon, graphite, diamond and fularine. So here also we can see that
 carbon is the single element but it has 4 different forms and that is 
 polymorphism.
 
 ___Concept of Polymorphism in Java :___
 <p>Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. 
 The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class
 reference is used to refer to a child class object. Any Java object 
 that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic. 
 In Java, all Java objects are polymorphic since any object will pass 
 the IS-A test for their own type and for the class Object. It is important 
 to know that the only possible way to access an object is through a 
 reference variable. A reference variable can be of only one type. 
 Once declared, the type of a reference variable cannot be changed. 
 The reference variable can be reassigned to other objects provided 
 that it is not declared final. The type of the reference variable 
 would determine the methods that it can invoke on the object. A 
 reference variable can refer to any object of its declared type 
 or any subtype of its declared type. A reference variable can be 
 declared as a class or interface type.
